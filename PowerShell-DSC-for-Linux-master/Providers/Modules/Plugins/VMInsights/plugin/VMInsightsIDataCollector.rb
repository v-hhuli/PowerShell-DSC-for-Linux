    # Design assumptions:
    # 1. Changing the number of active CPUs requires a system reboot.
    # 2. Assumption #1 is something that could change as virtualization technology evolves.
    # So:
    # 1. Gather the value once and cache it.
    # 2. Design the API so that the number of active CPUs is part of the data requested for each sample.
