Errors of this type are principally associated with a failure condition relating the to facility, or other environmental considerations. \n7 - Security Error. Errors of this type are associated with security violations, detection of viruses, and similar issues. \n8 - Oversubscription Error. Errors of this type are principally associated with the failure to allocate sufficient resources to complete the operation. \n9 - Unavailable Resource Error.
