# What is CDPx?

CDPx is the new build orchestration system which is offered both internally and externally which makes its support and tooling much more appealing compared to internal only toolsets (e.g. corext). 
We are not required to develop our code with CBT or CoreXT, and although both are supported, the recommendation is to go with vanilla msbuild/visual studio same as the retail experience for visual studio is.
