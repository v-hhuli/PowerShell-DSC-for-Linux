## Password reset

In addition to the above and in case you don't remember your current password, you can ask for new one by emailing [21V-WAPHYNET](mailto:21V-WAPHYNET@oe.21vianet.com). Template for such email can be found [here](./.attachments/CMEAccountPasswordResetRequestEmailTemplate.msg)

## Access jumpbox

As described in the link above, in order to access a jumpbox you need to issue a JIT request.
You can do that as described in the link or by using PS script from our share: \\\romedetection\Share\Tools\JITshell\Mooncake
