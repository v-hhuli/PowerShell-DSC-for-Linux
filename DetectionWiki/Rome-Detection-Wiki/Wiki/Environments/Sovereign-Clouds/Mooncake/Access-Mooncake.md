# Access Mooncake

## General

In Mooncake, as opposite to Fairfax, you can direct access to our subscriptions, without the need of escort session, using CME account and CME card

Saying that, you can still issue a escort session request and operate it as in Fairfax.

## Direct access

- First, be sure to have CME account and card (see dedicated page for that)
- Once you have such, you should ask for JIT to Mooncake. For that, see the [dedicated JIT page](../JIT.md) with the following changes:
-- No SAW required
-- Login to Mooncake JIT portal with your CME card (and not AME)
-- In the Direct/Escort option - choose direct
-- Work Item ID: 15079997 (not IcM, choose "other" instead)
- If you're asking for JIT using PS from Detection share directory, all params are already configured.
- Also, you won't need any additional approval for this request (it will be auto approved)

Once you asked for the JIT, you can access (http://portal.azure.cn)[http://portal.azure.cn] and you'll see our resources there.

## Escort session

Just as described in the [dedicated JIT page](../JIT.md)


## Detection devops tenant playground subscription and E2E subscription
