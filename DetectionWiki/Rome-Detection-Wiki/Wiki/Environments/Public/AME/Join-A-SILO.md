# General

A SILO is a repository of GPO (group policy objects) rules that get downloaded to your SAW machines when you log in to it.
The GPOs are responsible for creating all the restrictions and safeties to make the SAW a hardened working station (ex. Disabling your ability to be a local admin on your device).

# Prerequisites

You have [AME account](Create-AME-Account.md)
